# cic-wf

Playground implementation of the Calculus of (Co-)Inductive Constructions with
well-founded sized types for termination/productivity checking.

# Installation instructions:
Run `stack init; stack build` in this directory.

Duo to incompatibility of old versions of GHC and new versions of macOS, this
will not work with macOS >= 10.11.
I recommend using a linux system.

# Usage instructions:
Run `stack run cicwf file.cic` to execute the CIC^_ program in `file.cic`.
